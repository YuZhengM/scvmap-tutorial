2.5 Analysis
================

scVMAP provides four analysis tools with multi-level genetic regulation research,

Different analysis functions correspond to different analytical perspectives,
meeting the needs of various analysis users. The first analysis approaches
from a forward perspective by integrating scATAC-seq samples with causal
variant data. The second analysis explores the regulatory processes of
integrating scATAC-seq samples with causal variant data by using genes
as a hub. The third analysis investigates the regulatory processes of
integrating scATAC-seq samples with causal variant data by using transcription
factors as a hub.

In "Comparative analysis between samples or traits", users can compare the similarities and differences between traits within the same single-cell sample, as well as between different single-cell samples for the same trait.
