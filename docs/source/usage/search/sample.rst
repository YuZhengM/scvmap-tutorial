2.3.2  Search information by tissue type or cell type
=====================================================

 | Link: https://bio.liclab.net/scvmap/search

We provide two strategies for searching scATAC seq result data, namely searching sample data by tissue type and cell type. On the right side, a pie chart displaying different types of proportions based on different strategies is presented.


2.3.2.1 Tissue type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click "Search" to access the scATAC-seq result data based on the search criteria.

.. note::

    The selection box supports input prompts, and on the right side, you can click the cross to clear the input content.

.. note::

    The table displaying the result information is much richer than page `Data-browse <https://bio.liclab.net/scvmap/data_browse>`_.


2.3.2.2 Cell type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click the toggle button to switch to the cell type condition, and the distribution of cell type numbers in all single-cell samples will appear on the right.
